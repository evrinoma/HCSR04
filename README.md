# Description
Distance measurement using FPGA with ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 

Verilog hardware description to connect the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the Altera dev board with CPDL or FPGA. You should open the project file .qpf with a different version of Quartus software, in my case 15.0. Compile and test the project. 

##TODO
- Write description to communicate HC-SR04 by I2C protocol. And RaspberyPi drive to gather more data from sensor.
